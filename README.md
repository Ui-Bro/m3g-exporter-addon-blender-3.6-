# m3g-exporter-addon-blender-3.6-
This is an add-on for the old Blender 2.49 that is under development for an update to Blender 3.6+. It can export simple .m3g models and objects to jsr184 on the j2me platform.


The animation export system has not yet been implemented, as it is a very difficult part for those working alone in development, especially facing errors with headers, binaries, keyframe data, and bones.
